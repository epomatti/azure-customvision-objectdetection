# Azure Custom Vision - Object Detection

Azure Cognitive Services Custom Vision using the JavaScript SDK for Object Detection.

<img src="docs/beer_detection.png" width=250 />

## Infrastructure

Create the Cognitive Services resource:

```sh
az cognitiveservices account create -n '<name>' -g '<group>' --kind CognitiveServices --sku S0 -l 'eastus2' --yes
```

For Cognitive Services `--sku F0` tier is no longer available.

## Project Setup

Start by copying the sample `.env`:

```
cp example.env .env
```


Go to [customvision.ai](https://www.customvision.ai/projects#/settings) resources and copy the folling parameters:

üí° _I've opened [#14595](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/14595) to get the API Key using the CLI._


Now add the values to the `.env` file:

```sh
customVisionTrainingKey='<training_key>'
customVisionTrainingEndPoint='<endpoint>'
predictionResourceId='<prediction_resource_id>'
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è _Custom Vision recommends at least 50 images per set to ensure model performance. 
Following the rule of thumb 70/30 you should have at least 15 additional images for the prediction tests._

Set the remaining configuration for your project:

```sh
# Project 
projectName='<your_project_name>'
publishName='<publish_name>'

# Your sample data
trainingSampleDataRoot='<path>'
predictionSampleDataRoot='<path>'

# Separeted by commas (`,`):
tags='tag1,tag2,tag3'
```

## Training and Prediction

If you haven't already, download the dependencies:

```sh
yarn install
```

First you need to create your project and tags:

```sh
# This will create and output the project id
ts-node src/createProject.ts
```

Add the project ID output to the `.env` file:

```sh
projectId='xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'
```

Upload your images (_my script is limited to 64 images - help me with a pull request_ üòÅ):


```sh
ts-node src/upload.ts
```

_My algorithm is limited to send a single batch of 64 images - help me with a pull request_ üòÅ

Now, go to the [Custom Vision Portal](https://customvision.ai) and tag the images. You may add multiple tags for the same image.

You need to have at least 15 items for each tag for object detection.

After you tagged all the images, train your model. This will take a while:

```sh
ts-node src/training.ts
```

Run the prediction tests:

```sh
ts-node src/prediction.ts
```

This will also publish the iteration. You must unpublish previous iterations on the Performance tab at [customvision.ai](https://www.customvision.ai) if you wish to publish new ones.

You'll get an output for each image:
